	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>A slightly sweet, super savory vegetable and egg patty is sandwiched with smoky ham, melty Cheddar, and a ridiculous amount of mayo and ketchup between two slices of crispy, buttered bread.</p>
	<h2>Ingredients</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>1 cup thinly sliced cabbage</li>
		<li>1/3 cup julienned carrot</li>
		<li>1 stalk green onion</li>
		<li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
		<li>2 large eggs</li>
		<li>3 tbsp butter</li>
		<li>2 slices white bread</li>
		<li>1/2 tsp white sugar</li>
		<li>2 slices smoked ham</li>
		<li>1 slice cheese</li>
		<li>1 tbsp ketchup</li>
		<li>1 tbsp mayo</li>
		<li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Steps</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Mix cabbage, carrot, green onion, salt, pepper, and cayenne with your hands in a bowl until soft, about 30 seconds. Mix in eggs with a fork until thoroughly combined.</li>
		<li>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add bread slices and flip a few times to make sure both sides are coated with butter. Grill bread until beautifully toasted, golden brown, and a little crispy on both sides. Transfer to a plate.</li>
		<li>Melt remaining 1 tablespoon butter in the same skillet over medium heat. Add cabbage mixture; cook and simultaneously mix by using the edge of a spatula to chop down on the surface while pushing the edges up and over the top. As the mixture starts to hold its shape, form it into a rectangle that's about twice as long as it is wide. Split the rectangle in half into two square patties; continue to cook until golden brown, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes per side.</li>
		<li>Stack patties on top of one another onto one slice of toast and sprinkle with sugar.</li>
		<li>Place ham slices into the hot skillet; cook over medium heat until sizzling, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip and top with Cheddar slice; cook until melted, about 1 minute.</li>
		<li>Place ham and cheese on top of patties; top with ketchup, mayonnaise, and remaining slice of toast. Cut in half and serve.</li>
	</ol>
